# TrashBlocker
An Android app made in 2017 for The Great AZ Code Challenge

## What does this do?
This project allows do not disturb to be turned on from an app. This was one of my first projects in java, and I didn't have much time to improve it. I don't expect this to work well.

## Is there going to be updates or an .apk release?
No. I will not be updating this anymore and I will not make an .apk release until I download Android Studio again.
